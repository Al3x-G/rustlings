# Async in Rust

In modern software development, handling multiple operations at once is crucial for performance and responsiveness. Rust facilitates this through asynchronous programming, allowing your code to perform non-blocking operations efficiently. This chapter explores the key aspects of async programming in Rust.

## Introduction to Async

Discover the basics of asynchronous programming by writing your first async function. Understand how futures work and the differences between sync and async code.

## Using Async and Await

Convert a traditional synchronous function to use async/await syntax. This exercise helps illustrate the benefits and usage of Rustâ€™s async constructs.

## Error Handling in Async

Navigate the complexities of error handling in async code. Understand how errors propagate differently in async workflows and how to handle them effectively.
